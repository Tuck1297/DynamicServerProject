# DynamicServerProject
Project worked on in participation of a Web Development course at the University of St. Thomas. 
The goal of this project is to build a dynamic server that serves data about a specific 
sustainability topic chosen by the students working on this project. 


## Directory Structure
```
/home
    /total
        /annual/:year
        /monthly/:month_id/:year
    /sector
        /annual/:year
        /monthly/:month_id/:year
    /state/:state
```
Navigation works across all dynampic paths. Error code still needs to be created for each unique dynamic path. 

Website templates for navigation have been created. Need to finish design phase for rest of page. 

Added some basic foundation code to the error client response webpage (.html file).
